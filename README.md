# DevOps Project – Infrastructure as Code (IaC)


## Day 1:

- I developed the initial infrastructure using Terraform, provisioning AWS resources, including the creation of an S3 bucket to store the Terraform state and manage the infrastructure as code.

## Day 2:

- I implemented an automation pipeline using GitHub Actions to run Terraform in a controlled environment, integrating secure authentication with AWS and applying CI/CD best practices for infrastructure versioning, planning, and deployment.

## Day 3:

- I provisioned an Amazon ECR repository using Terraform, organizing the infrastructure into modules/directories and applying best practices such as image immutability, automatic vulnerability scanning, and standardized resource tagging. This step prepares the environment to securely store and version Docker images, integrating the infrastructure with an automated build and deployment workflow.
